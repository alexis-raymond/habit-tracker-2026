Week 1 (Jan 4),"January 4, 2026","I started off 2026 the right way. I spent time with family by going to Qc city and going for a coffee with them Sunday afternoon. I set up my goal management system and my personal vision board. I felt connected with Kristen and didn't have any fights. I set my boundaries with friends on NYE and spent time with Ryan and Paula, without overdrinking, which allowed me to wake up feeling good on Jan 1st. I bought my espresso machine and kindle which allow me to achieve some of my 2026 goals already. And I have been doing good and feeling motivated about my habits. Overall, it's been a great week!","Next week I will be going back to work and that will be the real test because my energy levels will be lower than they have been on vacation. I need to stay committed to my habits and my goals during that period. Considering my calendar and who will be in office, I don't think there is a need for me to go in person so I should protect my energy and work from home all week.","I did some progress on showing empathy. Yesterday, I said something that Kristen disliked when we were at my parents. I exaggerated the fact that she was on my case about buying the espresso machine. She didn't like that, because it made her feel like I thought she was trying to spend the money I got for Christmas. I felt myself get defensive in the moment, but instead or arguing with her, I took the time to understand why that hurt her and I was apologetic. In the end, this did not become a fight and I am proud of myself.","Matt called me yesterday and instead of screening his call, I called him back right away and spent 10 minutes catching up with him, even though it was at an inconvenient time for me. I promised to call him back next week during my commute. As mentioned, I spent time with Ryan and Paula on NYE and extended time with my family this week. I also reached out to Scott who I hadn't talked to in a while. My biggest challenge next week is that there is a boys night being organized. Going would go against my identity goal of protecting my time and intentionally drinking. But i don't have an excuse not to go.",No habits slipping yet. Like mentioned the real test will be next week when going back to work.,"Strong start to 2026. Key growth moment: caught himself getting defensive with Kristen and chose empathy instead—exactly the skill he's building. Being intentional about drinking on NYE, investing time in family, and calling Matt back immediately all align with identity goals. Important decision ahead: boys night next week will test whether he'll protect his energy or default to saying yes. Consider identifying 2-3 non-negotiable habit anchors before work starts."
