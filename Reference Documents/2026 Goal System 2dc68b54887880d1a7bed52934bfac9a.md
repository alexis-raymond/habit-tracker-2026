# 2026 Goal System

## Life Chapters

**Chapter 1: Childhood (0–15)**
Dependent on parents, progressing through life with no responsibilities. Learning, growing, being shaped.

**Chapter 2: Adulthood (15–25)**
Entering independence. Decided what I wanted to do in life, went to school, bought a house, started a serious relationship. Building the foundation.

**Chapter 3: Familyhood (25–45) ← I am here**
Transitioning from individual to family man. Getting married, buying a home that can accommodate kids, setting up financially, starting a family. Decisions center on "us," not "me."

---

*I invest my time in my partner, my family, and my closest friends. I protect my energy by saying no to what doesn't serve these priorities. Quality over quantity.*

# Part 1: Goals

## 1. Goals Overview

This system organizes goals into three types, each serving a different purpose:

| Type | What It Is | Purpose | How It's Measured | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Identity** | Who I'm becoming | Guide decisions and priorities | Not measured—used as a decision filter | "Be a partner, not just a fiancé" |
| **Outcome** | What I'm achieving | Define success for the year | Done or not done (checkbox) | "Buy a home" |
| **Habit** | What I'm doing repeatedly | Daily/weekly inputs that drive outcomes | Frequency/consistency over time | "Wake up at 6am" |

**Visual reminders:** The 2026 Bingo Card (created with Kristen) and Vision Board (iPad lockscreen) serve as daily visual cues of what matters most and who I want to become.

**The approach:** Identity goals guide decisions. Outcome goals define success for the year. Habit goals are the daily/weekly inputs that drive everything. I track habits in my app, review outcomes quarterly, and reference identity goals when I need to make hard choices about where to invest my time.

---

## 1.1 Identity Goals (Who I'm Becoming)

These aren't measurable—they're the person I'm working toward. I reference these when making decisions.

- **Be a partner, not just a fiancé.** Develop empathy. Make Kristen feel secure and prioritized. Put in effort even when comfortable.
- **Be a family man, not an individual.** Make decisions with "us" in mind. Invest time in relationship with parents and Jacob.
- **Be intentional with time and energy.** Say no to low-value activities. Quality over quantity. Drink less and only with intention. Keep work travel to max 1x/week. Protect what matters.
- **Be financially stable.** Excel at work to grow income. Be intentional with spending and savings to build a secure foundation for family.

---

## 1.2 Outcome Goals (What I'm Achieving)

These have a clear end state. I either accomplish them or I don't.

- [ ]  Get married
- [ ]  Buy a home
- [ ]  Buy high-end espresso machine
- [ ]  Pay off Civic
- [ ]  End 2026 with 25% net savings rate
- [ ]  Read 10 books
- [ ]  Take 2 vacations of 2+ weeks (honeymoon + holidays)

---

## 1.3 Habit Goals (What I'm Doing Repeatedly)

These are the daily/weekly/monthly behaviors I'm building into my life. All tracked in my habit app.

| Habit | Frequency |
| --- | --- |
| Wake up at 6am | Daily |
| Workout for 45 min | Daily |
| Go for 10 min walk at lunch | Daily |
| No phone in bedroom | Daily |
| Read before bed for 15 min | Daily |
| Get 8 hours of sleep | Daily |
| Call Jacob | Bi-weekly |
| Go on date with Kristen | Monthly |
| Weekly check-in in Claude | Weekly |

---

# Part 2: Tracking System

## 2. Tracking Overview

| Mechanism | Purpose | Cadence | What It Tracks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Habit App** | Track daily/weekly/monthly behaviors | Daily | Habit goals |
| **Weekly Check-in (Claude)** | Reflect on alignment, catch small drift | Every Sunday | Identity alignment, habit trends |
| **Quarterly Review (Claude)** | Recalibrate goals, assess progress | End of Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec | Outcome goals, system effectiveness |

---

## 2.1 Weekly Check-in (Sundays, 10 min)

Done in Claude project with 2025 retrospective and this goal system as context.

**Prompts to answer:**

1. What went well this week?
2. What do I want to do differently next week?
3. Did I show up as the partner/family man I want to be? Did I practice empathy—really understanding how Kristen or others were feeling? (If not, what got in the way?)
4. Who did I connect with this week? Who do I want to reach out to next week? (Remember: Matt often reaches out—am I reciprocating?)
5. Any habits slipping? What's one thing I can do to get back on track?

---

## 2.2 Quarterly Review (End of Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec, 1 hour)

Done in Claude project. Deeper reflection and recalibration.

**Part 1: Outcome Goal Check (15 min)**

- Review each outcome goal: On track / At risk / Completed / No longer relevant
- For any "at risk": What's blocking progress? What's one action to unblock?

**Part 2: Habit Trends (15 min)**

- Pull data from habit app: Which habits have strong consistency? Which are struggling?
- For struggling habits: Is the habit still important? If yes, what needs to change? If tracking too many, which 2-3 are non-negotiable anchors?

**Part 3: Identity Reflection (15 min)**

- Reread identity goals. Do they still resonate?
- Where did I live these out well this quarter?
- Where did I fall short? What pattern do I notice?

**Part 4: Alignment with Kristen (15 min)**

- Review bingo card together: What can we cross off? What are we excited about next quarter?
- Check in: How is she feeling about us? About our shared goals?
- Are we still aligned on priorities?
